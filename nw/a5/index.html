					Lawrence “Larry” Page was born on March 26, 1973, who is a well-known businessman, computer scientist and a co-founder of with his co-worker Sergey Brin. As of July 2014, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index lists Page as 17th richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $32.7 billion U.S. dollars. He is the inventor of PageRank, which is algorithm that Google uses for their search engine.

					His father, Carl Vincent Page, earned a Ph.D. in computer science in 1965, when the industry was first taking off; he was considered a "pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence ". He was a computer science professor at Michigan State University. His mother was an instructor in Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University. He holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan with honours and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. He holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan with honours and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. During his childhood his house was almost always a mess with computer parts lying around. He started to take an interest in computers when he started to mess around with the computer parts lying around. Page says that when he was 12 he was going to start his own company one day.

					In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google. Page ran Google alongside Brin until 2001 where they hired Eric Schmidt as Chairman and CEO of Google. Some time later, 2011, Google announced that Page was to replace Schmidt as CEO later that year.

					In 2004 both Page and Brin received the Marconi Foundation Prize and were elected members of the Marconi Foundation at Columbia University. When they were selected the foundations president, John Jay Iselin, congratulated them for, “their invention that has fundamentally changed the way information is retrieved today”. In 2011 he was ranked 24th on the Forbes list of billionaires and the 11th richest person in the Unites States of America.

					In 2007 Page married Lucinda Southworth in the Caribbean Islands. Southworth is a research scientist. They have two children born in 2009 and 2011. Before Southworth, Page dated former Google’s former head of location products, Marissa Mayer, who later on became the Yahoo’s CEO in July 2012. Page announced that his right vocal cord had become paralyzed from a cold that he had contacted, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999. Page later said that he had been under the effects of this vocal cord issue for 14 years, and his doctors are still unable to determine what cause this in the first place. A Google+ post revealed that he had donated a lot of money to a vocal cord nerve research program. An anonymous source stated that the donation pasts $20 million dollars. Later that year a Business Insider reported that his paralyzed vocal cords where the cause of an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

					Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin was born on August 21, 1973 in Moscow, Russia when Russia was still the Soviet Union. He is now an American computer scientist and Internet entrepreneur. With the help of Larry Page, co-founded Google. As of October 2014, his wealth is estimated around $ 29.9 Billion U.S. dollars. He moved from the Soviet Union to America with his parents at the age of six. . He acquired a degree from the University of Maryland in mathematics, to follow in his father and grandfather’s footsteps, along with computer science. After he graduated his meet later Page at Stanford University to acquire his PhD. Both Page and Brin stuffed their dorm room with cheap computers and applied Brin’s data mining system to these computers to build a search engine. As time went on their search engine became more and more popular. So they both decided to suspend their PhD’s to start up Google in a rented garage.

					His father is a mathematics teacher at the University of Maryland and his mother is a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Sergey’s father couldn’t follow his dream of coming an astronaut because he was Jewish. Jewish people weren’t allowed to have high position or paying jobs in the Soviet Union. So he decided to become a mathematician instead. He then later realized that he had to get is family out of Russia and somewhere else. When his family applied for a visa Sergey’s mother and father were both fired from their jobs. They had to get temporary jobs while they waited in fear of being denied as if was for many Jewish people that lived in the Soviet Union. They had received their visa and decided to move to the United States in 1979. In the summer of 1990 Sergey’s father lead a group of high school students and Sergey himself, for an exchange program to the Soviet Union. After remembering all of the childhood fear that he had experienced when he was younger, he pulled his father aside and thanked him for taking the family out of Russia.

					In May 2007, Sergey married biotech analyst and entrepreneur Anne Wojcicki. Him and his wife had two children, a son born in December 2008, and a daughter born in late 2011. Him and his wife share an interest in health. They both helped brainstorm with leading scientist on the human genome project. Brin said he, “instinctively regards genetics as a database and computing problem”. Anne co-founded a firm called, 23andME, which lets ordinary people compare and investigate their own genetic makeup. In August of 2013, they announced that they would be living separately. He later found out that his mother had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. He decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which is where his mother was being treated. Sergey used the tools at his deposal and discovered that Parkinson’s isn’t always passed down from generation to generation. He then realized that the gene that causes Parkinson’s, LRRK2, was in his genes and that his mother passed it down to him, which puts him between 20 and 80 percent chance of developing it. Sergey said in a an editorial in The Economist that he, “regards his mutation of LRRK2 as a bug in his personal code, and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that Google’s engineers fix every day. By helping himself, he can therefore help others as well. He considers himself lucky. ... But Mr. Brin was making a much bigger point. Isn’t knowledge always good, and certainly always better than ignorance?"
